Gradient Descent Algo Implementation


The "Gradient_Descent_Algo_Implementation" repository contains a basic implementation of the gradient descent algorithm in Python. Gradient descent is a first-order iterative optimization algorithm for finding the minimum of a function. This repository provides a simple example of how gradient descent can be implemented to optimize a linear regression model.
